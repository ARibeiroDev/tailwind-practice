# Acme Rockets — Tailwind CSS Practice Project 🚀

A modern, responsive landing page for a fictional space travel company, built entirely with **Tailwind CSS**. This project was created as part of a guided Tailwind CSS course by Dave Gray.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates core Tailwind CSS concepts such as responsive design, utility-first workflow, layout composition using Flexbox and Grid, and minimal JavaScript for interactivity.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Fully Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly across devices using Tailwind’s mobile-first approach with breakpoints, Grid, and Flex utilities.
- 🎨 **Utility-First Styling**: Clean, maintainable markup with no custom CSS — all styling handled through Tailwind's utility classes.
- 🍔 **Custom Animated Hamburger Menu**:  
  Built using a single `<div>` and styled with `before` and `after` pseudo-elements, fully animated with Tailwind transitions — no icon libraries used.
- 🌌 **Modern Hero Section**: Eye-catching hero section with CTA and overlay effects using background utilities and z-index control.
- 🛰️ **Reusable Components**: Sections (like services, testimonials, call-to-action) created with reusable layout patterns.
- 💡 **Dark Mode Ready** (optional future upgrade)
